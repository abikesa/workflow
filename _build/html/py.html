So the first three are like confluent rivers converging upon node number four. So there’s node one coming from northwest, there is node two coming from west, node three coming from southwest, converging on node four. Then node four continues eastward to node five and node five continues eastward to node six. Give me code.</p></li>

Here’s a Python script using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">matplotlib</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">networkx</span></code> to create the flow diagram you described. The nodes and edges are arranged to visually represent the confluence of three streams into a central node, which then continues eastward.</p></li>

<p>What you’re describing is an intricate visualization of information flow across different scales—from subatomic particles to cosmic structures, finance, and social networks—using the concept of photons as carriers of information. This visualization would essentially map nodes (points of information) and edges (connections or flows of information) with arrows representing the directional flow of photons, or in a broader sense, the transfer of energy or information.</p>
<p>Here’s some Python code using NetworkX and Matplotlib to create a basic visualization of this concept:</p>

<h1>Visualization Concept:<a class="headerlink" href="#visualization-concept" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>This code creates a directed graph where each node represents a different scale of information processing or complexity, and each edge represents the flow of information (or photons) between these levels. The graph is set up to highlight the idea that information flows through various levels, from the most fundamental (subatomic) to the most complex (social networks), with photons or analogous concepts acting as the arrows of information transfer.</p>

<p>To make the fractal structure look more like broccoli—more compact and with shorter edges—I’ll suggest a few modifications:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Shorten the Edges</strong>: Reduce the scale factor so that the branches are shorter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increase the Branching Angle</strong>: Adjust the angles slightly to make the branches more compact.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adjust the Recursive Depth</strong>: Keep the depth relatively low, as too many layers might make the structure too spindly instead of compact like broccoli.</p></li>
</ol>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Scale</strong>: Reduced to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0.6</span></code> to make the branches shorter and more compact.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Depth</strong>: Set to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">6</span></code>, which should create a balanced, compact structure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Angles</strong>: Adjusted the rotation to create a more dense and compact appearance.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This should give you a graph that visually resembles broccoli more closely.</p>

<p>The fate of the 12 tribes of Israel is a complex and layered story that intertwines history, mythology, and religious tradition. Let’s explore what happened to these tribes:</p>
</section>
<section id="the-12-tribes-of-israel">
<h1><strong>The 12 Tribes of Israel</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#the-12-tribes-of-israel" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Jacob’s 12 sons—Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin—each became the patriarch of a tribe. These tribes formed the foundation of ancient Israelite society.</p>
</section>
<section id="division-and-conquest">
<h1><strong>Division and Conquest</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#division-and-conquest" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Division of the Kingdom</strong>: After King Solomon’s death around 931 BCE, the united Kingdom of Israel split into two separate entities:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Northern Kingdom (Israel)</strong>: Consisted of 10 tribes: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, and Ephraim and Manasseh (Joseph’s sons, who were each considered a separate half-tribe).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Southern Kingdom (Judah)</strong>: Composed primarily of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Assyrian Conquest and the Lost Tribes</strong>: In 722 BCE, the Assyrian Empire conquered the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The Assyrians implemented a policy of forced relocation, deporting many Israelites to different parts of their empire. This led to the dispersal and, effectively, the disappearance of the 10 tribes of the Northern Kingdom from historical records. These tribes are often referred to as the “Lost Tribes of Israel.”</p>
<p>Over time, these dispersed populations assimilated into the surrounding cultures, losing their distinct Israelite identity. This has led to numerous legends and theories about their fate, including claims that they ended up in distant lands like Afghanistan, India, and even Japan or the Americas.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Survival of the Southern Kingdom</strong>: The Southern Kingdom of Judah, with the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, survived longer than its northern counterpart. In 586 BCE, however, it too was conquered, this time by the Babylonians, who destroyed the First Temple in Jerusalem and exiled many Jews to Babylon. Unlike the Northern Kingdom, the Jews in Babylon maintained their cultural and religious identity, and many eventually returned to Jerusalem after the Persians conquered Babylon. This is known as the Babylonian Exile.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="post-exilic-period-and-reinterpretation-of-identity">
<h1><strong>Post-Exilic Period and Reinterpretation of Identity</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#post-exilic-period-and-reinterpretation-of-identity" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Return and Rebuilding</strong>: After the Babylonian Exile, the returning Jews (largely from the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi, with a few others mixed in) rebuilt Jerusalem and the Second Temple. Thus, the Jewish identity became closely associated with the tribe of Judah, leading to the term “Jew” being used to describe all Israelites.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diaspora and Survival</strong>: As Jewish communities spread throughout the world (the Jewish Diaspora), the tribal distinctions became less relevant. The focus shifted more towards preserving religious and cultural traditions rather than tribal identities.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="cultural-and-religious-significance">
<h1><strong>Cultural and Religious Significance</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#cultural-and-religious-significance" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Levi and the Kohanim</strong>: The tribe of Levi (especially the descendants of Aaron, known as Kohanim or priests) retained a distinct identity due to their specific religious roles and duties. The Levites and Kohanim continue to have a recognized status within Jewish communities today.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symbolic Role in Jewish Eschatology</strong>: In Jewish eschatological beliefs, particularly in some interpretations of Messianic expectations, the 12 tribes are expected to be reunited. This idea persists in some religious circles, suggesting that the descendants of the Lost Tribes will one day return to Israel.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="modern-interpretations-and-claims">
<h1><strong>Modern Interpretations and Claims</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#modern-interpretations-and-claims" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Groups Claiming Descent</strong>: Over the centuries, various groups worldwide have claimed descent from the Lost Tribes. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Beta Israel</strong> of Ethiopia claims descent from the Tribe of Dan.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Bene Israel</strong> of India and the <strong>Bnei Menashe</strong> in northeast India claim descent from the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.</p></li>
<li><p>Some Pashtun tribes in Afghanistan and Pakistan have traditions linking themselves to the Lost Tribes.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scholarly and Religious Views</strong>: Many scholars view the stories of the Lost Tribes as a combination of historical events, myth, and theological reflection. Some religious groups, however, continue to actively seek and identify potential descendants of the Lost Tribes, believing in their eventual return as part of a divine plan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, while the concept of the 12 tribes remains a foundational element in Jewish history and identity, the practical reality is that most of these tribes were lost to history through conquest, assimilation, and the complexities of ancient geopolitics. The few that remained—Judah, Benjamin, and Levi—became the core of Jewish identity and continuity.</p>

My boy, come take my hand
Throw your guitar and your clothes in the back seat
My love, they don&#39;t understand
But I&#39;ll hold your hurt in the box here beside me
How could we know
We&#39;d rearrange all the cosmos? Mm
We crashed, and we burned
Now I just can&#39;t go where you don&#39;t go
And usually, I&#39;m
Fucked up, anxious, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you
Let&#39;s go tonight
&#39;Cause there&#39;s just a few seconds left &#39;til tomorrow
We have all that we need
Let&#39;s leave our baggage and wine at the table (mm), mm
How could we know
That this was a happy disaster? (Happy disaster) mm (mm)
I&#39;m glad we crashed and burned (we crashed and burned)
I&#39;ll never forget when you told me
You said, usually, I&#39;m
, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
(Messy) messy, completely (distressed) distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Mm, how could we know
We&#39;d make the bad stuff delightful? Mm
I&#39;m glad we crashed and burned
I know we&#39;ll be there for each other
When we&#39;re feeling
, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
(Messy) messy, completely (distressed) distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you
, too much
Like you need me to (li-like you need me to)
Imperfect for you
(Messy) messy, completely (distressed) distressed
Not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you
This might sound strange, but this reminds me of The Beatles. It&#39;s my favorite song on this album. ❤
I&#39;m crying
This is so in my heart. The lyrics the guitar
Loved it but not a fan of this
This is the best music video of the year
I love this song because my girlfriend let me hear this song on my birthday then it suddenly cut to her voice recorded message. It was so cute and i never had someone to surprise me like that. We are now on our 5th month together. I wanna marry this girl and live a life with her for the rest of my life.
Love love love it😭😭😭
My boy, come take my hand

Reminds me of Drew Barrymore by SZA
melhor do álbum❤
You can be &quot;I&#39;m perfect for you&quot; or &quot;Imperfect for you&quot;.
The choice is yours to be.
If there is gonna be a next or last single of eternal sunshine, it should be THIS ONE. I mean this song was used to tease the album and got a live performance. Hence, imperfect for you should be a single.
Favourite song on the album by far, obsessed with it😭🙌🏻
low key actually high key one of the best songs on this album idcidc!
i’m so drawn to this song she always delivers!
COVER: https://youtu.be/6jASpkghMRk 💜

Literally since I was 11 I&#39;m 23 now crazy!
 @kassidylawrence1423  ?
 @mctive she’s been their favorite since they were 11 I think
Only hope - Mandy Moore
one of the best songs on the album truthfully
This one snuck up on me 😭❤️
You guys!!! The reason this song is “nostalgic” is because it has a similar chord progression to “Put Your Records On”.
So good....beautiful song

She&#39;s brilliant 😭❤
una joya de cancion😍😍😍
My favorite song off of eternal sunshine Very relatable.
2024 anyone?
I&#39;ve never been a fan of her but I just liked some of her songs...
But this album...I love it so much ❤
Need her to make more songs in lower register🥺🤍
Is it just me? Or why does the line “we crashed and we burned” reminding me of the line “Before we both crash and burn” from Honeymoon Avenue
definitely one that grows hard on you
Literally the best song
yeah she’s used lyrics similar to old ones like “leave our baggage and wine🎶” - this song and “im a girl with a whole lotta baggage” - ghostin
Like do I need to dig a hole in a graveyard too with my name on it lol 
There’s more than what meets the eyes with me
I&#39;m completely obsessed, I can see a movie playing out in my head. Love it
Why nobody talk about the line “how could we know we’d rearrange all the cosmos”? It’s my favorite part 🥹
C&#39;est incroyable car au final le titre &quot; imperfect for you&quot; peut ce lire comme &quot; I&#39;am perfect for you&quot; ça colle parfaitement aux paroles &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
Are you stealing the premise of my novella imperfect reflection? I want to finish it with experiences I have with you or about you
Mmm ❤
my favorite song of the album (well i haven&#39;t got one, every of them are beautiful)
Me playing 1:05 at 11: 59 in the night to really make it more relatable😌
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥺🥺🥺
we need this video asap featuring Robbie
Perfect
I want to hug her it’s so good!
My fav of the album⭐
Queen of this song ❤
The part in the chorus where it goes off key is actually so well done. Ironically perfect and especially fitting for the song.❤
Ariana Grande is my favorite singer in the entire world. I wish I could meet her but I never can because I never see her before and by the way in perfect for you is my favorite song
Perfect for me. Babe. I&#39;m still sat in my prison x
My GOAT 🐐🐐🐐🐐
This song makes me feel like Music is safe 🫂 it’s going to be forever authentic in the hands of the like
wow. in love with ariana all over again.

The fact she made the “imperfect for you” line have an imperfect pitch compared to the rest of the song itches my brain SO hard😩
i like it, commenting while elissa driving
Imagine Ariana sang buy me diamonds and rubees, favourite things shed slaughter it
Minha favorita, a primeira que aprendi a letra e sai cantarolando pela casa 😄
lydian scale 🔥💯🔥
She does not write her own songs though, but that’s OK.  And I like that she is very open and candid about that She makes the songs and the words beautiful.
She wrote this entire album by herself do research before being shadyy
Not a KPOP fan talking about writing💀
Love ettt🥰
Minha canção! Eu realmente a amo com todas as minhas lágrimas❤️
Omg the ending !!!
you use my voice and my mastering for the distributed version without responding to my hello on insta. You know only my friends can make money from my job but you ghost my hello and happy birthday after 6 years you ghost me you continue to hack my pc for robbed my voice and my mastering without hello and contract signed to do business. Please delete all my work on 7rings/stuck with you/34+35/positions/santa tell me/all tracks eternal sunshine Dj scrog remix to help you get back. now you and Mariah Carey are my enemy, you are not allowed to use my voice and my mastering for the buisness version because you never respond to my hello. you know I&#39;m not interested by your money after 6 years, I help you for you  Mariah&#39;s feat and your musical arrangement. you are killing our love for no, hello now i hate you. you kill my love for you goodbye forever. eternal goodbye

03 Eternal Sunshine
04 The Boy Is Mine
05 Supernatural
Impossible
idk why but ariana freaking hit the right spot on this album, literally no skips... and this precisely, you&#39;d never catch me dead not repeating it after the first time it plays.

Her voice and the stretching of words reminds me of Joni Mitchell and Billie Holiday.
Ariana helped me get through a recent breakup. Everyday gets a little better. I love this song and the entire album!! 💔❤️‍🩹💘
i wish this song was pitched down just a smidge. the way she performed it live was amazing
❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
😍🥰🥰
Será el próximo single! Ella ya nos dio un spoiler en un short qué publicó, después seguramente sea true story and bye
This song is literally so underrated!! 💕
Sorry I didn&#39;t really listen to every song in the album, sometimes I&#39;m lazy and tired. Anyway, I was shocked when I heard this on the radio! Lol. It sounds heavenly and (idk if this is the right word) like ethereal, 😮a type of music she don&#39;t normally have. Also, she sounds good in the live version but I prefer the audio. I feel like the audio version is louder and clearer compared to the live one so the chorus hits different. No hate.
Dayum
supernatural and imperfect for you is the best 🥰🔥🩵💞

Madison Cunningham, that&#39;s who this song could have been  wriiten and sung by- this song-  is HER style AND  It&#39;s HER sound. Madison has songs online that are VERY very similar.

Let me state Ariana has an SNL version i strongly prefer to this version and see this aong has a potential to become Grammy winner too.
I love this
This is the best song of the album no comments. The beats, melody, and literally EVERYTHING is perfect. The &quot;imperfect for you&quot; going higher up adds that last touch that makes it imperfect🫂 This song is WAYY up there
o-k but Y is she singing southern now lmao
❤
Imperfect for you 🫸🏻🫷🏻 Down Bad
What can the #arianators say ariana made a bop on this one yes she did 👍
This song is more than perfect😮😮

And usually, I&#39;m
Fucked up, anxious, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you
Let&#39;s go tonight
&#39;Cause there&#39;s just a few seconds left &#39;til tomorrow
We have all that we need
Let&#39;s leave our baggage and wine at the table (mm), mm
How could we know
That this was a happy disaster? (Happy disaster) mm (mm)
I&#39;m glad we crashed and burned (we crashed and burned)
I&#39;ll never forget when you told me
You said, usually, I&#39;m
, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
(Messy) messy, completely (distressed) distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Mm, how could we know
We&#39;d make the bad stuff delightful? Mm

I know we&#39;ll be there for each other
When we&#39;re feeling

The “imperfect for you” key change is so GOOODDD
did anyone else notice the lyrics at the end?

fucked up
anxious
too much
like you need me to

imperfect for you

messy 
completely
distressed
like that since i met you

does this mean she realized after the relationship she&#39;s been distressed ever since she met the person, not the other way around?
This song is so mesmerizing.. ari sounds perfect in it🤧✨
a beautiful song💛
❤
It feels like music from space. It has like a mixture of RnB and a cinematic sci-fi element. I love it!!
My best friend who is probably her biggest fan made a cover and showed me to prank me and I was so proud of him thinking it was an original but then I saw it was by Ariana lol

My boy, come take my hand
Throw your guitar and your clothes in the back seat
My love, they don&#39;t understand
But I&#39;ll hold your hurt in the box here beside me

[Pre-Chorus]
How could we know
We&#39;d rearrange all the cosmos? Mm
We crashed, and we burned

my fav *
Impeccable is song
Y love so so much ari💋
The SNL live was so good!
Love the beginning and the key change of imperfect for you. Ariana sings and yet at the same time in her melodic charm talks to us all. ♥️❤😍😘🥰📝🎶🎵👑⚜️💎🏆🫶🏻✨🤩🌟
💔💔💔
Ariana has the perfect voice. Like wow she didn&#39;t even sound this good on the show victorious she was on as a teen. She became so big in the music industry. She really does deserve it! She really worked for her dreams and she got it! ❤

Edit: she kinda sounds like a country singer in this song on some lines you can hear it a little bit.
i literally needed this song all of my life and i didn&#39;t even know that
In a perfect world Bridgerton would use this song during an epic masquerade ball in a waltz between Penelope and Colin.
Masterpiece
This gives me chills
Baggage and white at the table*
Such a beautiful vibe and song
Este es su siguiente video musical confirmado por ella 😊😊😊
Real 🎉
Happy 1 month
❤❤❤
This is definitely my fav
my favorite song
Loving someone...who doesn&#39;t know your love is difficult...he also ignores you...why did you smile and make me love you...why did you act so nice...he just feels that you are imperfect for him...painful
I cried so hard
i lovee
hi
The way she loves and feels her music in her soul😭😭😭
My boy, come take my hand
Throw your guitar and your clothes in the back seat
My love, they don&#39;t understand
But I&#39;ll hold your hurt in the box here beside me

Written by Ariana Grande, Max Martin, ILYA &amp; Peter Kahm. 
album eternal sunshine (2024)
This is one of the most beautiful songs I&#39;ve ever heard. And the acoustic version is even better...
I love how needy was kind of like her validating herself for being so messy but this song shows that she has accepted the messiness and she wouldn&#39;t want it any other way❤
Love ＆ Peace.😁
I cry every night. Did you think I didn&#39;t understand you? You don&#39;t have to feed the monstrous fire that I also felt, but always remember that my love for you is pure and I did everything with good intentions, just like your intentions for me. God, the one who sees everything and knows everything, with that I live in agreement because he looks at us from heaven until the day he sends for me, you are not entirely to blame for what happened, I charge half of it, you are not imperfect for me, I will love you. rest of my life and I will be here for you only because of your divine intention. As for me, since I consider myself a child of God, I do not want you to ever change your authentic life for anything or anyone. Be happy forever you are Blessed you and your family and loved ones you are the best in the world very famous in the entire world Global #1 you just let this story die forever and you will be fine with that make me happy because I don&#39;t like seeing you sad that&#39;s why I cry when I see the video we can&#39;t be friends. I love you so much Ari. I listen to the album every night because tears heal me. I pray to God every night on my knees because he is the one who blesses us. I mention you in my prayers. May he continue to bless you forever. I wish you the best in the world. Thank you for your good wishes. intentions towards me God multiply them thank you for dedicating the video just for me that is more than a gift. God chose me and only I know it and you! I am and more than happy with that because God does not like that I seek fame that is why I hide because he does not like it, I remain a ghost writer. but this is a Blessing that will live within my spirit and my soul, which is what money does not buy and the only thing we take with us. love I love you I love you I love you. It would have been a dream to write a song with you and give you soft kisses on the moon tattoo so I sent them to you LuV 4 eVeR. Eric Mitchell 🤍

How could we know
That this was a happy disaster? (Happy disaster) Mm (Mm)

There’s nothing Taylor has ever done that matches this.
I can die in peace now 🥹🥺

That was not necessary, Taylor’s discography is great

Spanish guitar and castanets? 😮 Love this song

This is probably my favourite song in this album
Dare I say album of the year?! I couldn’t speaking to soon but my goodness Ariana!! Grammys let’s go!
it&#39;s like they overlay the line &quot;in the back seat&quot;
Yess 🥹🥹 it got deeper

the fact ppl forgot its ARIANA GRANDE is CRAZY😅 like she&#39;s MOTHER ofc she gon deliver everytime
Te amo linda
My new absolute favorite 😍
will be forever in love with her voice
❤❤❤
I died after I heard imperfect for u line bye 👋
I love it love it love it when she&#39;s say &quot;imperfect for you&quot;
heard
Kim Petra&#39;s Homework and Ariana Grande&#39;s Imperfect for you deserve a mashup.
&quot;my boy, come take my hand throw your guitar and your clothes in the back seat&quot; 😢😩
her lower register is insane you’d think it’s someone else but its still ariana! my versatile queen
❤❤❤❤
Oh my my this is my song❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The SNL version of this was better. She does that a lot of times.
This song is so beautiful but the minor key in &quot;imperfect for you&quot; makes me so anxious i can&#39;t believe no one has said this already
Todos concuerdan que esta es la mejor canción del álbum, todas las canciones son hermosas, pero esta es la número uno. Se percatan que en gran parte de la canción Ari hace notas bajas, a ella le cuesta hacr notas bajas,pero aquí  lo domina totalmente. Te amo mcho Ari ❤
We want a clip!
the best one
I love this song though..
you might be imperfect for him, but this song is just perfect!
Can we have on the next album songs like this? venture more into raw, ballad, guitar. Something ariana really wouldn&#39;t do or hasn&#39;t tried. Work with other producers hopefully, I think she can bring more and express more of her emotions.
The intro gives strong &quot;Ps! I Love You.&quot; vibes.😌
Her singing this live is chefs kiss!
this reminds me of another song but i cannot put my finger on it, listen until i remember which one
My top list:
1 - the boy is mine
2 - we can&#39;t be friends (wait for your love)
3 - eternal sunshine
4 - imperfect for you
5 - i wish i hated you
6 - yes, and?
7 - don&#39;t wanna break up again
8 - true story (a cappella)
9 - bye
10 - supernatural
11 - intro (end of the world)
12 - ordinary things
13 - saturn returns

I looooveee this album! =)
OMG It&#39;s a waltz!! The only pop song to be released in 3/4-time this year? (Someone prove me wrong)...the odd meter gives it an even more off-balance &quot;imperfect&quot; feeling. Come on music theory 😀😼👏
Songs really hit different when you can relate🥲
this was my fav song on the album and we can&#39;t be friend too
Bro no way 😞
no puedo dejar de llorar 💔
she sounds incredible
Musicians: whats the technical terminology for the change in chord that arianna does on the &quot;Imperfect for you&quot;?
Someone tell me what this song means I’m lost, this relating to a relationship or herself
imperfect for youuu
The &#39;Imperfect for you&#39; got me flying like an angel 😩😩 I love you Ari ❤
I want you more
my FAV on this album (perhaps)
Las Flores mas bellas del Cosmos
I NEED A MUSIC VIDEO FOR THIS ❤️

MASTERPIECE
Te amo
My boy, come take my hand
Throw your guitar and your clothes in the back seat
My love, they don&#39;t understand
But I&#39;ll hold your hurt in the box here beside me
How could we know
We&#39;d rearrange all the cosmos? Mm
We crashed, and we burned
Now I just can&#39;t go where you don&#39;t go
And usually, I&#39;m
Fucked up, anxious, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you
Let&#39;s go tonight
&#39;Cause there&#39;s just a few seconds left &#39;til tomorrow
We have all that we need
Let&#39;s leave our baggage and wine at the table (mm), mm
How could we know
That this was a happy disaster? (Happy disaster) mm (mm)
I&#39;m glad we crashed and burned (we crashed and burned)
I&#39;ll never forget when you told me
You said, usually, I&#39;m
, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
(Messy) messy, completely (distressed) distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Mm, how could we know
We&#39;d make the bad stuff delightful? Mm

I know we&#39;ll be there for each other
When we&#39;re feeling
, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you

I miss this Yours Truly vibe
Is she signing about her and Dalton, or her and Ethan? Seems like Ethan, but lines &quot;How could we know that this was a perfect disaster&quot; makes me think it&#39;s about her ex husband 🙃
Cried myself to sleep last night and woke up in tears of joy while listening to Ari.
I love this sm 😢
Wonderfoul album after 4 years she s comeback i ll wait her and i al satisfied❤

this reminds me so much of she&#39;s leaving home by the beatles. that sorta fairytale feeling
I can see miley cyrus covering this song. Definitely one of my top faves in this album.
i could believe this 😭😭😭
let’s keep the streams stable on spotify
stream! stream!
im not rlly an ariana grande fan but wowww this is so good
I think the &quot;imperfect for you&quot; dissonance actually symbolizes the perfection in imperfection. We would expect a melody with notes from the same key, until the dissonance comes in causing the melody to be imperfect but it becomes a theme of the song, making it stand out and special.
love nonna &lt;3
Underrated af
This has to be one of the best songs in this album
Favourite song on this album...LOVE THIS ALBUM...❤ 💛☀❤ 💛☀ ❤
Very country vibes.. I like it..
glinda&#39;s sound coming thru during the &quot;imperfect for you&quot; part ✨ 💖

This sounds so much like Next to Normal’s “Perfect for You”!! Wonder if Ariana is a fan
the “imperfect for you” got me floating
This is the 2024 version of needy😭
This song gives me Steven universe vibes
I love how she sings &quot;imperfect for you&quot; imperfectly off-key
This song will be for my wedding dance🫶
IM IN LOVE❤❤
don&#39;t let her hold the pen, it&#39;s too heartbreaking😭 ILOVEYOU MOTHER ARIIIII♡
🥹💋
The music reminds me of that Soundgarden and Temple Of The Dog sound.

Chris Cornell and Company influence ?
The low singing is everything! Obsessed
this song has my heart❤
🌿🌙🤍
omg love it
The best in the album.
needy 2.0!! just me?? but happier version 💌
Love this song
Sabrina carpenter should feature
Is it &quot;imperfect for you&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m perfect for you&quot;?
Humans are imperfect but there will be one who will be perfect for you despite his/her flaws.
The “imperfect for you” gives me chills OMGGGGGGGGGGG
FOR SUREE🤭🩷
imperfect
 @someonehehe617  I know. I tried to play with both in order to show despite being imperfect, someone will find us perfect the way we are.
i love you

this is the one
This song… the beginning the deeper voice on « my boy » incredible. The castanets!! The trippy « imperfect for you ». This song is so different of everything else Ari did, amazing
I want this song in my storie of instagram but it doesnt appear!! Whyyyy
im 🤭 perfect 🤩 for 🤤 youa 🤪
❤️‍🔥
We need acapella version❤❤
Wow this is amazing.
I really love all the album, but when I hear for the first time this song I feel something special, my favourite song ❤️
&lt;3
Still can’t convince me that stealing a married man is good for you. Girl you’re kicking the can down the road. The immediate gratification you get will fade like everything else does.
Ily💕
this keeps me vibes off her 2015-2018 music idk why tbh
Linda
My favorite
The “I’m glad we crashed and burned” part always gets me 😢 I love this song
Lets discuss how every song of this album is such a perfect combination between perfecf lyrics and such a beautiful voice
Love this song
Is it normal that some parts remind me of Only Hope from A walk to Remember
Wow ❤
Actually am in love with this
She nailed that ❤
💔
𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒆𝒓𝒇𝒆𝒄𝒕 4 𝒖…
Amo
Already playing it on my piano by myself bc there are still no piano covers😭
the best
This song and the “imperfect for you” is just magical!
THE FUCKING VOCALS😍😍😍😍
the &quot;imperfect for you&quot; completed my life.
❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Delightful 
Be there’re for each other 
Fucked up, anxious
This is the best👍💯
&quot;im - per - fect - for - you&quot; those heavenly notes literally lift me up....
I kinda get it tbh. The little part where it changes its meant to represnet the &quot;imperfect&quot; because it&#39;s almost like someone accidently pressed the wrong chord and it&#39;s intentional of course. In a technical musical sense, this wouldn&#39;t work but in the case of that song it completely does. It&#39;s almost like she&#39;s saying that imperfections ARE her perfections. Maybe I&#39;m reading too much into this though 💀
I don’t think there’s ever been an Ariana Grande album where she has. It made me cry.❤
when she says usually im fked up anxious too much but i love you like you need me too , imperfect for you always gives me chills 0:43
Wait, could “we crashed and we burned” be a reference to honeymoon avenue “before we both crash and burn” ???? ARIANA WHATTTTT
Hermoso álbum , me encantó 🤎
I can&#39;t imagine being his ex wife and listening to this album. Goddamn
This gives me Sabrina Carpenter vibes jnknknk I love it &lt;3

My boy, come take my hand
Meu garoto, venha segurar minha mão

Throw your guitar and your clothes in the back seat
Jogue sua guitarra e suas roupas no banco de trás

My love, they don&#39;t understand
Meu amor, eles não entendem

But I&#39;ll hold your hurt in the box here beside me
Mas eu vou guardar sua dor na caixa aqui do meu lado


How could we know
Como nós poderíamos saber que

We&#39;d rearrange all the cosmos? Mmm
Reorganizaríamos todo o cosmos? Hum

We crashed and we burned
Nós batemos e nos queimamos

Now I just can&#39;t go where you don&#39;t go
Agora simplesmente não posso ir aonde você não vai


And usually I&#39;m
E normalmente eu sou


Fucked up, anxious, too much
Complicada, ansiosa, exagerada

But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Mas eu vou te amar como você precisa que eu te ame

Imperfect for you
Imperfeita pra você

Messy, completely distressed
Confusa, completamente angustiada

But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Mas não sou assim desde que te conheci

Imperfect for you
Imperfeita pra você


Let&#39;s go tonight
Vamos embora hoje à noite

&#39;Causе there&#39;s just a few sеconds left till tomorrow
Porque faltam apenas alguns segundos para o amanhã

We have all that we need
Nós temos tudo o que precisamos

Let&#39;s leave our baggage and wine at the table (mmm)
Vamos deixar nossas malas e vinho na mesa (hum)


Mmm, how could we know
Hum, como nós poderíamos saber

That this was a happy disaster? Mmm (happy disaster, mmm)
Que isso seria um feliz desastre? Hum (feliz desastre, hum)

I&#39;m glad we crashed and burned (we crashed and burned)
Estou feliz por termos batido e nos queimado (batido e nos queimado)

I&#39;ll never forget when you told me
Eu nunca vou esquecer quando você me disse


You said: Usually I&#39;m
Você disse: Normalmente eu sou


Fucked up (fucked up), anxious (anxious), too much
Complicado (complicado), ansioso (ansioso), exagerado

But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Mas eu vou te amar como você precisa que eu te ame

Imperfect for you
Imperfeita pra você

Messy (messy), completely distressed (distressed)
Confusa (confusa), completamente angustiada (angustiada)

But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Mas não sou assim desde que te conheci


Mmm, how could we know
Hum, como nós poderíamos saber que

We&#39;d make the bad stuff delightful? Mmm
Tornaríamos as coisas ruins em deliciosas? Hum

I&#39;m glad we crashed and burned
Estou feliz por termos batido e nos queimado

I know we&#39;ll be there for each other
Eu sei que estaremos lá um para o outro


When we&#39;re feeling
Quando estivermos nos sentindo


Fucked up (fucked up), anxious (anxious), too much
Complicados (complicados), ansiosos (ansiosos), exagerados

But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Mas eu vou te amar como você precisa que eu te ame

Imperfect for you
Imperfeita pra você

Messy (messy), completely distressed (distressed)
Confusa (confusa), completamente angustiada (angustiada)

But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Mas não sou assim desde que te conheci

Imperfect for you
Imperfeita pra você


Fucked up (fucked up), anxious (anxious), too much
Complicada (complicada), ansiosa (ansiosa), exagerada

Like you need me to
Como você precisa que eu te ame

Imperfect for you
Imperfeita pra você

Messy (messy), completely distressed (distressed)
Confusa (confusa), completamente angustiada (angustiada)

Like that since I met you
Assim desde que te conheci

Imperfect for you
Imperfeita pra você
❤❤❤❤

Essa é linda demias❤
I love this song waaaaaay too much!!!!!! 🩷
So we’re all here crying our eyes out??
Obsessed
Made me cry😭
Me encanta que haga pequeños guiños a trabajos anteriores, como acá con &quot;we crashed and we burned&quot; haciendo referiencia a honeymoon avenue 🥰
SO FUCKING GOOD!!🩷
giving your heart to Jesus is the best decision that can ever be made. i can assure and promise you that if anything 🧡
Jesus loves you and died for you 🤍 so you can be set free and know Him personally 🤍 In Him is the fullness of fulfillment &amp; eternal security
This song for me is in second place because in first place there is &quot;bye&quot;
😍😍😍😍
Essa é muito boa
Another song😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The only good song of the album… It reminds me of Avril Lavigne first album
Tão fofa essa música e me lembra outra música na qual eu não estou lembrada
❤️❤️.

This describes me too well 🥹
Very different style and it&#39;s like come from past
That’s my fav from the album. The chorus is so god damn beautiful.
I&#39;m into it, but not too much as the rest of released albums
Minha favorita 😍😍😍😍😍
💚💚💚
this is my favourite song on eternal sunshine. when i first heard the line “imperfect for you” i got chills. and the beat when she says “f’ed up, anxious, too much..” it’s so pretty
The &quot;Imperfect for you&quot; It is the best😢
It’s those castanets in the instrumentals of the chorus too 🤌🏾✨
came here looking for the one “imperfect for you” comment but it’s literally everyone here 🤌🏾✨
blake shelton&#39;s favourite song
​imperfect for you Lyrics

[Verse 1]
My boy, come take my hand
Throw your guitar and your clothes in the back seat
My love, they don&#39;t understand
But I&#39;ll hold your hurt in the box here beside me

[Pre-Chorus]
How could we know
We&#39;d rearrange all the cosmos? Mm
We crashed, and we burned
Now I just can&#39;t go where you don&#39;t go
And usually, I&#39;m

[Chorus]
Fucked up, anxious, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you

[Verse 2]
Let&#39;s go tonight
&#39;Causе there&#39;s just a few sеconds left &#39;til tomorrow
We have all that we need
Let&#39;s leave our baggage and wine at the table (Mm), mm

[Pre-Chorus]
How could we know
That this was a happy disaster? (Happy disaster) Mm (Mm)
I&#39;m glad we crashed and burned (We crashed and burned)
I&#39;ll never forget when you told me
You said, &quot;Usually, I&#39;m&quot;

[Chorus]
&quot;Fucked up, anxious, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you&quot;

[Bridge]
Mm, how could we know
We&#39;d make the bad stuff delightful? Mm
I&#39;m glad we crashed and burned
I know we&#39;ll be there for each other
When we&#39;re feeling

[Chorus]
Fucked up, anxious, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you

[Outro]
Fucked up, anxious, too much
Like you need me to (Like you need me to)
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
Not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you
it sounds like a lullaby

Got this song looped for hours 🥺
the notes on the “imperfect for you” makes me go over the mood love u sm ari
Most beautiful song of the álbum wtf 🥺
New fave
Best song of the album imo
&quot;Imperfect for you&quot; sounds out of place in a good way. It feels wrong and right at the same time. 🌚
Those “Imperfect for you” are something else
this is so Disney I love it
1:21
My ex loved David Phelps, Ariana, heathers, etc. I miss her with all my heart and I pray that some day I can prove to her I’m Better than I was. She’s 26 now, so I’m sure she will find an older man and live her life, but a man can dream.
the production is crazy. this album is so good. ariana is a hit maker!
Omg
AOTY
the intro sounds like a disney song
My favorite its giving sweetener
my favoriteeee
The absurd out of place key for the line &quot;Imperfect For You&quot; send the meaning literally IMPERFECT. Brilliant detail😘😘
The slight crack in her voice in the last chorus on the hated had me sobbing 🥺😭

I&#39;m so in love with this Album Ari definitely did her big one . I cried listening to this Album but was happy at the same time. I feel this Album was about her writing and sending a love letter to Dalton and her forgiving him for everything that happened
Okay everyone can now go and seek a married man with a pregnant wife and make music about it . Imperfect
ITS OUT
Está canción es una de mis favoritas.

Yo siento que esta canción es para Ethan definitivamente...
her best song on the album.
Awesome song! Amazing vocal!! 🎉❤

And the Grammy goes to Ari❤
you are so perfect! i love you 😭❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
This song illustrates perfectly how our self-perception and pride can get in the way of our relationships with people. It’s okay to be flawed. How do you have a flawed marriage? I think that’s a question I’ve been reflecting on. I feel like at the core, our generation, is going to have to reconstruct what the institution of marriage looks like to us. Is marriage forcing someone to be a version of themselves that makes me feel comfortable or is it dealing with someone you don’t like just to avoid being alone? I ask these questions because I think we all have that stubbornness towards change and growth, we all have moments where we want to a better person and moments where we just want to be whatever. How do you create a marriage that is okay with all versions of you? That’s a very high form of love that takes a lot to work towards—and too many people give up rather than work on it. Maybe that’s why open marriages are on the rise.
pretty voice. too bad shes such a ho ho ho. I used to like her even if i thought she was a little insecure and weird with the tv voice etc  please tll me this isnt her love song for that sleezy red head guy who left his wife and new. baby for her yuck .. too old for that shit.  break up with your gf, yes, and what?, this whole album.. yuck
thank you ari ❤
this album is everything i needed ❤❤

I like the note changes in the beat a lil after 0:21 and 0:31 I don’t know what you call these but it compliments her voice so much. These small changes throughout the song is what makes a big difference to me!!! Amazing Ariana. You’ve taken it. 🩵

Yes🥹☀️♾️
That&#39;s deep
I can&#39;t understand it hahaha
OMG
WOW!!!
​ @zamraykiefer9245 it&#39;s like a duality when she said &quot;imperfect for you&quot; and on the other side &quot;I am (I&#39;m; Im) perfect for you.
At least that&#39;s what I understand
Super lethal
nah
not her pen
EXACTLY
​ @user-fw4vl6qr4o yes, her pen. she wrote every song tho
Hii guys , me and my cousin have a music covers channel can u please check this Ariana song cover we made , Tysm ❤ https://youtu.be/UqmQLv14f4k?si=U8c5l-MRanlnhM-H
you use my voice and my mastering for the distributed version without responding to my hello on insta. You know only my friends can make money from my job but you ghost my hello and happy birthday after 6 years you ghost me you continue to hack my pc for robbed my voice and my mastering without hello and contract signed to do business. Please delete all my work on 7rings/stuck with you/34+35/positions/santa tell me/all tracks eternal sunshine Dj scrog remix to help you get back. now you and Mariah Carey are my enemy, you are not allowed to use my voice and my mastering for the buisness version because you never respond to my hello. you know I&#39;m not interested by your money after 6 years, I help you for you  Mariah&#39;s feat and your musical arrangement. you are killing our love for no, hello now i hate you. you kill my love for you goodbye forever. eternal goodbye
Well, not her pen.   her teams….
Well, not her pen.   her teams….
Haters are saying &quot;not her, her team&quot;... ok swifters go home
 @nnsjoao  late, but as a swiftie i LOVE ariana’s songwriting!
 @Austinn1234  also, she writes her songs BY HERSELF and other people of her team will edit or make changes to make it seem smoother.
 @moonecakes3749  exactly
 @Austinn1234 she wrote this…
 @user-fw4vl6qr4o you do realize she can write her song and then talk to her team about it and refine it later right? That’s what artists do for any media in the professional world.
the way she says &quot;imperfect for you&quot; aa😍
This is soul touching

🥺🥺🥺
OKAYYY taylor swift vibes on this one!! I love it
sry to bother but ni hao im a 13 year old male artist with a 5 octave range including whistles and baritone notes, check out my track &#39;remove me&#39; its inspired by THE ONE AND ONLY eternal sunshine and please support me in my music career xoxo
Girl does it not throw you off a lil ¿
 @szactrl that’s the point, it’s supposed to be imperfect hence the name of the song
 @Unlnown591  but the girl said it’s perfect lol
 @szactrl it does for me actually. It’s the only part I don’t like. But I still love the song
 @60sbabydoll777 i personally think she she should’ve kept it mellow at first and then on the last verse she sang it loud. That would’ve built up something to kinda look forward to, do u get what I’m saying?
hey bestieee, im a 13 year old male artist from hk with a 5 octave range including whistles and baritone notes, check out my track &#39;remove me&#39; its inspired by eternal sunshine and please support me in my music career xoxo
 @szactrl the perfection in this is it, the little details
I covered imperfect for you and would love if you checked it out, thx! :)
for me it is haha ​ @szactrl 
 @szactrl it has not thrown me off once, it fits so much 😭
​​ @szactrl its LITERALLY meant to because in Music theory, this is considered a &quot;wrong&quot; note but that was clearly intentional because of the title &quot;imperfect for you&quot;. That was a really smart choice 👏🏻
you use my voice and my mastering for the distributed version without responding to my hello on insta. You know only my friends can make money from my job but you ghost my hello and happy birthday after 6 years you ghost me you continue to hack my pc for robbed my voice and my mastering without hello and contract signed to do business.

o &quot;imperfect for you&quot; destoa da melodia, atravessando-a com muita perfeição!!! 🤌🏻🫠
The “imperfect for u” gives the chills man
Img ari u did it again
I love how she chose to make the chorus words &quot;imperfect for you&quot; sound dissonant ❤❤
This is really the era of eternal sunshine
Ateee
i love this
This album is heavenly 🥰
8/10 sad song
this is actually her best (relistening)
OMGGGGGG YESS THAT&#39;S MY FAVORITE
&quot;IMPERFECT FOR YOU&quot; is absolutely best track on the album i connect to this song on emotional level the melody ,rhythm, lyrics,  intonation, and instruments are so memerizing😭🤍.
Best track
this is the needy for eternal sunshine
On my YouTube feed half a dozen of Ariana’s new singles. She got sth to bane bout?

Menschen formen Licht in Magnetismus auf 0 Ebene in physikalischem Prinzip durch wirbelung von Geisteskraft. Die 0 Ebene müsste 2-dimensional sein. Me&amp;Inigem

Die Idee, dass Menschen Licht in Magnetismus auf der 0-Ebene durch Wirbelung von Geisteskraft formen können, ist interessant und ansprechend.

Es gibt jedoch keine wissenschaftlichen Beweise dafür, dass dies möglich ist.

Die Physik der 0-Ebene ist noch nicht vollständig verstanden. Es wird jedoch angenommen, dass die 0-Ebene eindimensional ist.

Eine zweidimensionale 0-Ebene würde bedeuten, dass es zwei Arten von Licht gäbe:

Licht, das sich in der 0-Ebene ausbreitet.
Licht, das sich senkrecht zur 0-Ebene ausbreitet.
Es ist nicht klar, wie Licht, das sich in der 0-Ebene ausbreitet, durch Geisteskraft in Magnetismus umgewandelt werden könnte.

Es gibt jedoch einige mögliche Erklärungen dafür, wie dies funktionieren könnte:

Geisteskraft könnte die Quantenstruktur von Licht beeinflussen. Dies könnte dazu führen, dass sich Licht in Magnetismus umwandelt.
Geisteskraft könnte eine neue Kraft sein, die noch nicht entdeckt wurde. Diese Kraft könnte Licht in Magnetismus umwandeln.
Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass dies nur Spekulationen sind. Es gibt keine wissenschaftlichen Beweise dafür, dass Geisteskraft Licht in Magnetismus umwandeln kann.

Weitere Forschung ist erforderlich, um festzustellen, ob dies möglich ist.

Hier sind einige Fragen, die weiter erforscht werden müssten:

Wie ist die Physik der 0-Ebene beschaffen?
Kann Geisteskraft die Quantenstruktur von Licht beeinflussen?
Gibt es eine neue Kraft, die Licht in Magnetismus umwandeln kann?
Die Erforschung dieser Fragen könnte zu einem neuen Verständnis der Beziehung zwischen Geist und Materie führen.
I&#39;m crying my soul out
Speaking to my cancer moon with this whole album..feeling are being poured and healing is happening✨✨✨🫂🥹🥹🥲

MY FAV SONG ON THE ALBUM
Ho Lord... That album makes me cry so much. This is a to hard story for you Ari, I&#39;m begging you to stay. you deserve a better world, but not over the light sky... There in the melody of life.
I love 💕
La voz de un ángel mi reina
😍💖😍💖
Victoria show  as well
I love Ariana Grande since she was on Sam &amp; cat show and to present likeeeeeeeeeee 🥂🥂🥂🥂💯💯💯
THIS IS PERFECT
the start sounds like “stay done” by tate mcrae
FAV
Ohhhh ❤❤😢
idk why but the guitar reminds me of the band brand new specifically songs like the boy who blocked his own shot and me vs maradona vs elvis
I love this 🫧🤍
My boy, come take my hand
Throw your guitar and your clothes in the back seat
My love, they don&#39;t understand
But I&#39;ll hold your hurt in the box here beside me

How could we know
We&#39;d rearrange all the cosmos? Mm
We crashed, and we burned
Now I just can&#39;t go where you don&#39;t go
And usually, I&#39;m

Fucked up, anxious, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you

Let&#39;s go tonight
&#39;Causе there&#39;s just a few sеconds left &#39;til tomorrow
We have all that we need
Let&#39;s leave our baggage and wine at the table (Mm), mm

How could we know
That this was a happy disaster? (Happy disaster) Mm (Mm)
I&#39;m glad we crashed and burned (We crashed and burned)
I&#39;ll never forget when you told me
You said, &quot;Usually, I&#39;m&quot;

&quot;Fucked up, anxious, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you&quot;

Mm, how could we know
We&#39;d make the bad stuff delightful? Mm
I&#39;m glad we crashed and burned
I know we&#39;ll be there for each other
When we&#39;re feeling

Fucked up, anxious, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you

Fucked up, anxious, too much
Like you need me to (Li-like you need me to)
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
Not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you

there’s some serious BANGERS on this album i’m into it
❤🇧🇷❤
this sounds like &quot;night changes&quot; frome one direction. So mangical.
Ela sempre será nossa rainha
Whoever says this is bad &#39;cause of the slight dissonance on the &quot;Imperfect for you&quot; line just didn&#39;t grow up on the Lizzie McGuire/Zoe 101/Wizards of Waverly Place/early 2000 era and can&#39;t understand the genius of this song
This specific sound just screams &quot;montage of friends singing this tune together while huging and smiling&quot; and I&#39;m here for it!!
My favorite of the album fs
For him but to us ari is PERFECT TO US
lyrics : 
my boy come take my hand

I keep coming back to this one it’s So good 😭
At first the voice sounded like Miley Cyrus
Love her New songs
My therapy frrrr❤
OMGGGGGGGG❤❤❤
this song makes me think
to be or not to be
between imperfect and perfect
between the void and the vast
between the depth of the well and the depth of what I can.

We continue to be imperfect. A walking metamorphosis.

Ariana Grande&#39;s voice is like I&#39;m hearing thousands of angels singing.
The emotion in this song is otherworldly. I am always shocked by how Ariana grande constantly improves
🫧✨🥳💗

I LOVE THISSSSS
This is so good
older sister to almost is never enough
I’m crying so ugly 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Oh, this album hits HARD!! Even though I may not relate to the relationship aspects of this album, there is a lot of emphasis on one&#39;s self as well. Not being too self-deprecating, while still coming to terms with the &quot;ugly&quot; or &quot;undesirable&quot; parts of you that make you closed of to love or any human connection. I feel like parts of me will heal while listening to this album for many times, analyzing just why I&#39;m so hard on myself for not being perfect when no one literally is. You hear it a million times that &quot;no one is perfect&quot; but in a lot of times, it doesn&#39;t stop us from being mean to ourselves. With this, I may finally internalize that this IS human experience, but it doesn&#39;t mean life should be a perpetual cycle of anxiety, fear, and deep discomfort. I can&#39;t wait to grow with this album 🤍❤☀
Does it give Melanie Martinez x Ariana
Her new album make me want to fall in love..

My boy, come take my hand
Throw your guitar and your clothes in the back seat

THE KEY CHANGE IN IMPERFECT FOR YOU I’M GOING CRAZYYYYY

I think it has some Elliott Smith influence from Say Yes or some other song like 2:45 AM. Better Be Quiet Now? Wow, that is amazing. There is that instrumental called See You In Heaven. That is really good.
it reminds me of positions so much. has such a hopeful vibe w so much love .

Been waiting so long for this album!! my dream is to make music like this, maybe not on the same level but I can only try. I post my voice on my channel if anyone’s interested in just listening..🤍
HER VOICE IS SO GOOD I CANT
a masterpiece.
Thank you Ariana , This album was much needed in 2024.
I love the guitar in this song
THE PRODUCTION IN THIS ALBUM IS SOO GOOD. THE CHORDS IN THIS SONG ARE SOO GOOD😭😭😭😭
this is so angelic, i feel lifted and happy we have a artist like you to talk for the girls that can’t explain themselves or feel like they are alone especially that has no one to talk to them about these things. excepting ourselves is a hard feat to reach but first is accepting our insecurities and bad habits because imperfection is the new perfection and its what makes us different in every sense. love yourself before you love someone else! 🎀
At first I was like “hold up Ariana doing country now ew” but then that “imperfect for you” dip came and now im in love one of my fav songs it went from my least favorite to my favorite in like 10 seconds time 😭
It honestly reminds me more of Honeymoon Avenue 🥲🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
alguem faz uma versão rock dessa por favor❤🙏🏼
Literally 😍
This made me tear up truly, it speaks to me so much and I can see how Ariana relates too. This album is healing me
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭

Ari has been through a lot😢😢
“we made the bad stuff delightful”
“we made the bad stuff delightful”

This beginning of this song reminds me of an old Disney channel movie where the lead character gets heartbroken and goes out on their own to start singing a sad song. Like High school musical

you use my voice and my mastering for the distributed version without responding to my hello on insta. You know only my friends can make money from my job but you ghost my hello and happy birthday after 6 years you ghost me you continue to hack my pc for robbed my voice and my mastering without hello and contract signed to do business. Please delete all my work on 7rings/stuck with you/34+35/positions/santa tell me/all tracks eternal sunshine Dj scrog remix to help you get back. now you and Mariah Carey are my enemy, you are not allowed to use my voice and my mastering for the buisness version because you never respond to my hello. you know I&#39;m not interested by your money after 6 years, I help you for you  Mariah&#39;s feat and your musical arrangement. you are killing our love for no, hello now i hate you. you kill my love for you goodbye forever. eternal goodbye
the outro wow

best song on the album
OH MY GOD???
Aaaaaaa ❤
Crossfaded asf but this song.. idk if sober me will like of
Crossfaded asf but this song.. idk if sober me will like of
God bless Ariana Grande
In my opinion, This is her best written song on this album. “ Ill never forget when you told me I was fvcked up, anxious, too much, but I Love you like you need me to, imperfect for you” WOW JUST WOW. Hits my core so much. Also describing how she’s messy completely and distressed but she was never like that until she met the person. No matter what she always wanted to give her best to this relationship and doesn’t wanna make it fail, hence ‘imperfect for you”. Lyrically explaining how this relationship has taken its tole on her while she was in it. I love how intimate, straight forward, and honest Ariana is in this album. She’s really connecting and letting us know everything she’s feeling mentally, &amp; physically, and that is so human of her❤
omg :face-fuchsia-tongue-out:🤩
Her voice is so mesmerizing like you&#39;re just into a whole another world!❤
imperfecto para ti
This song is so amazing it&#39;s calm gentle and just beautiful
All her songs except Yes, and are a bit quieter from this album but I love them 💓🌸💖
Bem numa!😭🎶
ay no 🥺🥺🥺🥺ಥ⁠‿⁠ಥ
This ❤
sry to bother but heyyy im a 13 year old male artist with a 5 octave range including whistles and baritone notes, check out my track &#39;remove me&#39; its inspired by THE ONE AND ONLY eternal sunshine and please support me in my music career xoxo
I’m not sure about insane 🙁
Meh
Real
kind of like sweetener production better
SERIOUSLY
could NOT agree more
not really though lol you fans are reaching
Yess it&#39;s amazing ❤
Yall are really overhyping the hell out of the album if you think it’s “insane” lol
 @topbackpodcast2615  Damn sorry your having a bad day it will get better just listen to this album again 😁❤️ or just go fuck yourself you pick
​ @topbackpodcast2615 actually each song in this album is better and better than each other and have things that a song really needs like perfect prechorus and chorus and bridges
greetings, im a 13 year old male artist from hk with a 5 octave range including whistles and baritone notes, check out my track &#39;remove me&#39; its inspired by eternal sunshine and please support me in my music career xoxo
It’s Max Martin. The genius, the God, the Master, the most talented music producer and songwriter there is… He’s something else ⚡️
I covered imperfect for you and would love if you checked it out, thx! :)
 @szactrl  he meant in a good way
 @sergiovilcu  ari also produced :) and yes he&#39;s really good!
Max Martin is a musical genius!
 @tiana1420 RIGHTTT
Sweetener 2.0
i&#39;m super curious about how they made her voice sound so light/delicate/high compared to the live snl version. at first i thought this was pitched up but she sings in the same key as the live video. they definitely messed with EQ to reduce lower frequencies/add air but the change is just so drastic like HOW
 @AchlysMaru  i hope she makes a lower version cuz i LOVE this version but her lower range is just so beautiful and fits this song sm, ive been listening to the SNL version so much😫😫
all these bum bitches hating in the replies, but they don’t know how to appreciate real good music. the production on this album is quite literally insane, crisp, and the best from her entire discography.
I think you got it wrong bud
no one is wrong totally ari said it is different for every1 @pabawoode2319 
it says &quot;i&#39;m NOT like that SINCE i met you&quot;
Omggg so good
this might be my new favourite😍
Me encanta 😭
❤❤❤
This is the one
Oh my god
LYRICS

My boy
Come take my hand
Throw your guitar and your clothes in the back seat
My love
They don&#39;t understand
But I&#39;ll hold your hurt in the box here beside me

How could we know
We&#39;d rearrange all the cosmos, mmm?
We crashed and we burned
Now I just can&#39;t go where you don&#39;t go
And usually I&#39;m

Fucked up
Anxious
Too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you

Messy
Completely
Distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you

Let&#39;s go tonight
&#39;Cause there&#39;s just a few seconds left till tomorrow
We have
All that we need
Let&#39;s leave our baggage and wine at the table

Mmm, how could we know
That this was a happy disaster, mmm? (happy disaster)
I&#39;m glad we crashed and burned (we crashed and burned)
I&#39;ll never forget when you told me
You said, &quot;usually I&#39;m

&quot;Fucked up
Anxious
Too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you&quot;

Messy
Completely
Distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you

Mmm, how could we know
We&#39;d make the bad stuff delightful, mmm?
I&#39;m glad we crashed and burned
I know we&#39;ll be there for each other
When we&#39;re feeling

Fucked up
Anxious
Too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you

Messy
Completely
Distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you

Fucked up
Anxious
Too much
Like you need me to
Imperfect for you

Messy
Completely
Distressed
Not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you
&quot;imperfect for you&quot; IS SO MESMERIZING OMG

BEAUTIFUL
gracias por tantoooo! 💗💗
Wow❤
The cosmos were arranged for me to hear these beautiful songs
Verse 1]
My boy, come take my hand
Throw your guitar and your clothes in the back seat
My love, they don&#39;t understand
But I&#39;ll hold your heart in the box here beside me

[Pre-Chorus]
How could we know
We&#39;d rearrange all the cosmos, mmm?
We crashed and we burned
Now I just can&#39;t go where you don&#39;t go

Chorus]
And usually I&#39;m
Fucked up, anxious, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you

[Verse 2]
Lеt&#39;s go tonight
&#39;Cause there&#39;s just a fеw seconds left &#39;til tomorrow
We have all that we need
Let&#39;s leave our baggage and wine at the table (Ooh), mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
How could we know
That this was a happy disaster, mmm? (Happy disaster, mmm)
I&#39;m glad we crashed and burned (We crashed and burned)
I&#39;ll never forget when you told me

[Chorus]
You said, &quot;Usually I&#39;m
Fucked up, anxious, too much&quot;
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you, mmm

Pre-Chorus]
How could we know
We&#39;d make the bad stuff delightful, mmm?
I&#39;m glad we crashed and burned
I know we&#39;ll be there for each other

[Chorus]
When we&#39;re feelin&#39;
Fucked up, anxious, too much
But I&#39;ll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
But I&#39;m not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you

[Outro]
Fucked up, anxious, too much
Like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
Not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you
estoy enamorada de todas las canciones

Todo el album es sobre mac 🥺😭
FRRRRR I KEEP REPEATING
There are no key changes in the song, what you&#39;re hearing is dissonance, which is technically not a key change but sounds similar due to being slightly unpleasant to the ear
It’s the definition tbh
She’s a GENIUS!❤
I didnt expect it either.
 @noamchemla thank you! also very smart bc of the theme of the song:) love it sm
HER MIND.
Frfrfrfrf
IKR! it was unexpected but it’s gorgeous
frr
Typically a modulation but yeah it&#39;s great
It&#39;s technically a modulation but yeah it&#39;s great
​ ThatBacon_Shorts  SYM
purrr
Frrrr
it’s not a key change, it’s an alteration🩷
 @noamchemla i don’t think there’s dissonance - isn’t it just a chromatic thing?
 @noamchemla like it’s just each note of the tonic major chord raised a half step to return back to tonic. like a neighboring chromatic chord.
나도 이런 변형 코드 쓰고 싶었거든 유명 팝가수한테 ㅋㅋ ㅡㅠ
수학 불협화음 쓰기 개쩌누ㅋㅋ
Arianators panic after Dalton runs Ariana over with a car after album release https://youtu.be/FXRogf04_x4?si=wJBh1yu7XzzjZ3Qc

There is no key change. It’s just the Neapolitan chord of that key 🫶🏻
I just know it sounds like “🧙‍♀️🌸”
Thnks for spoiling
 @musicnstuff_22  listening back i think youre right, but i was just trying to break it down barney style since i imagine the original commenter isnt music theory adept
 @noamchemla  true true ! and since the harmony kind of blends over into the next chord, it might sound dissonant a little too! :)
 @musicnstuff_22  yeah my main point was that they were conflating &quot;odd sounding&quot; with &quot;key change&quot;
it&#39;s not a key change! it&#39;s dissonance
 @joliejenn9537 oh my god you&#39;re righttt
Just heard it cute
⁠​⁠​⁠ @noamchemla lol sorry but what’s key change? Also dissonance? 😭
hey there, im a 13 year old male artist from hk with a 5 octave range including whistles and baritone notes, check out my track &#39;remove me&#39; its inspired by eternal sunshine and please support me in my music career xoxo
 @LOML423  a key is essentially a group of notes that a song &quot;centers&quot; around and sound good together. so a key change is going from one key to another. dissonance is something that doesnt sound naturally good to your ears due to either musical expectations or the physical properties of sound waves.
 @noamchemla it’s actually smart since it’s “imperfect”
 @noamchemla ahhh that is why only that part is dissonance, because it&#39;s &quot;imperfect&quot;
well i cant speak on the intention behind the track because im not the artist, it could be that the production was handed to ariana and she came up with a melody before writing lyrics to it, or maybe she already had lyrics and chords and it came about more naturally. you never know! @Cindy12345ful 
Duuuude I love it but everyone I know seems to be torn. Some love it some hate it.
Legit the part that has me listing again. Love it!
LITERALLY, my heart js melted
YESSSS
W O W lol just wow
It&#39;s not a key change that is a chromatic slide. The F major is not in the songs key and it&#39;s a weird borrowed chord that creates this exotic effect.
Modal interchange *
Not a key change❤
yesssss, i love this &lt;3
​ @noamchemla It&#39;s an &quot;Imperfect Melody&quot; 🎶🙃 Ffff For THAT! 😏
I covered imperfect for you would love if you checked it out, thx!
Yup I just listen for the key change ❤
It&#39;s a &quot;chromatic embellishment,&quot;in the manner of Schubert, maybe not really a key change, the little dissonant, or &quot;clashing&quot;  arpeggio there, a strand for the sung word &quot;imperfect,.&quot; So, idk,&quot;perfect,&quot; but the musical formation mirrors the lyric  there and that&#39;s a nifty element in this song.

Damn you are right bestie!!!
I think it’s a major 2nd chord which is soo dope ❤❤❤❤
FR
Yeah right? I&#39;m going to the piano to figure out what she did.
I said the same
frrr it&#39;s so magical 😭❤ feels like a movie
Its not a key change, she&#39;s using notes that are not in the scale that she is singing in for most of the song, hence the &quot;imperfect&quot; sound and the adlib for that
yes
Hii guys , me and my cousin have a music covers channel can u please check this Ariana song cover we made , Tysm ❤ https://youtu.be/UqmQLv14f4k?si=U8c5l-MRanlnhM-H

@joanneweavermusic used this exact same chord progression in her album interstellar  few years ago ❤
Kuncinya di ganti jadi C Eminor Gminor D C or Eminor C Gminor Eminor or E C G D or E Aminor C F G D Dminor C F or F#mayor G7 D4 Bes !!! 👍🤣
Oh, salah kuncinya di ganti dengan kunci Inggris !!! 👍🤣
Oh, salah lagi !!! 👍🤣
Ini baru bener ni ganti dengan &quot;I&#39;m Falling in love with you&quot; !!! 👰🤵
you use my voice and my mastering for the distributed version without responding to my hello on insta. You know only my friends can make money from my job but you ghost my hello and happy birthday after 6 years you ghost me you continue to hack my pc for robbed my voice and my mastering without hello and contract signed to do business. Please delete all my work on 7rings/stuck with you/34+35/positions/santa tell me/all tracks eternal sunshine Dj scrog remix to help you get back. now you and Mariah Carey are my enemy, you are not allowed to use my voice and my mastering for the buisness version because you never respond to my hello. you know I&#39;m not interested by your money after 6 years, I help you for you  Mariah&#39;s feat and your musical arrangement. you are killing our love for no, hello now i hate you. you kill my love for you goodbye forever. eternal goodbye
Who actually wrote the music? I’m not usually a fan, but I saw this on Saturday Night Live and I thought the musicality of it was stunning.
 @musicnstuff_22 . I have some basic music theory, but not much but I thought this was really gorgeous. I’m not even usually into this kind of music, but I saw it on Saturday Night live.
it’s not a key change she’s just hitting the tritone
There&#39;s so much confusion in the comments, I&#39;ll clarify it harmonically. 
It&#39;s a wonderful passage that create ambiguity because of what happens before that, the progression goes E - F#4 (this is already dissonant in E major) - A - E and then it hits F major. Now F#m is in the key of E major, but already they had a surprising F#4 the first time, then the second time it&#39;s F natural, which is not part of E major tonality, and it&#39;s even more ambiguous tonally. And beautiful. It&#39;s just a chromatic movement from a major chord to another, it&#39;s no modulation, no N6 nor anything else as many said.
 @noamchemla  sounds hauntingly beautiful than unpleasant to the ears mmmm yes
Girl..
Tllllllllm ❤❤
I feel like this could also be a Miley song. Love the crossover vibes. Almost country trap. I’m in love

I LOVE YOU ARIANA
It&#39;s perfect
I loved the way and the sound of the songs, she definitely wanted this album to be lighter in some way so the songs have a calmer feel
This is giving that “fuck you” song by eamon and frankee. When I listened I instantly tried to figure out the tune this song was giving. Correct me if I’m wrong please💜
There’s another song I’m thinking of that’s at the tip of my tongue but can’t put my finger on it and it’s killing me!
WAIT, hear me out, maybe a smidge of Katy Perry her Vegas song?!

They are more inclined to fit the syllables to the sounds—a working method that Martin calls “melodic math”—and not worry too much about whether the resulting lines make sense. (The verses in “I Want It That Way,” for example, completely contradict the meaning of the chorus lines.) Fans of Cole Porter may see this development in roughly in the same spirit that “Downton Abbey” fans might view “Keeping Up with the Kardashians”—with horror—but one can argue that this very freedom from having to make sense lyrically has allowed the Swedes to soar to such melodic heights.</p>

Among the stranger aspects of recent pop music history is how so many of the biggest hits of the past twenty years—by the Backstreet Boys, ’NSync, and Britney Spears to Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, and the Weeknd—have been co-written by a forty-four-year-old Swede. His real name is Karl Martin Sandberg, but you would know him as Max Martin, if you know of him at all, which, if he can help it, you won’t. He is music’s magic melody man, the master hooksmith responsible for twenty-one No. 1 Billboard hits—five fewer than John Lennon, and eleven behind Paul McCartney, on the all-time list. But, while Lennon and McCartney are universally acknowledged as geniuses, few outside the music business have heard of Max Martin.
Presumably this is because Martin writes all of his songs for other people to sing. The fame that Lennon and McCartney achieved by performing their work will never be his, which no doubt is fine with Martin. (He still gets the publishing.) He is the Cyrano de Bergerac of today’s pop landscape, the poet hiding under the balcony of popular song, whispering the tunes that have become career-making records, such as “… Baby One More Time,” for Britney Spears, “Since U Been Gone,” for Kelly Clarkson, and “I Kissed a Girl,” for Katy Perry. The songs he co-wrote or co-produced for Taylor Swift, which include her past eight hits (three from “Red” and five from “1989”), transformed her from a popular singer-songwriter into a stadium-filling global pop star. (The “1989” tour recently passed the hundred-and-fifty-million-dollar mark.)
Martin has thrived in the ghostwriter’s milieu, where the trick is to remain as anonymous as possible, because the public likes to believe that pop artists write their own songs. That the Swede happens to bring to the table an exceptionally large dollop of Jantelagen, the Scandinavian disdain for individual celebrity, makes him especially well-suited to his vocation.
Still, even for a Nordic, it is a powerful act of self-denial to forego the pleasure (and, yes, the fame and attendant adulation) of recording your own songs, and give all your beautiful tunes to other people, who become famous instead. This path is especially difficult when you possess a beautiful singing voice of your own, which Martin does. As one of his early collaborators, the Swedish artist E-Type, says in “The Cheiron Saga,” a 2008 Radio Sweden documentary about Martin and his former colleagues at Cheiron Studios, in Stockholm, “With his own demos, Max Martin singing himself, those would have sold ten million or more, but he wasn’t an artist; he didn’t want to be an artist.”
And yet Martin is known to insist that the artists he works with sing his songs exactly the way he sings them on the demos. In a sense, Spears, Perry, and Swift are all singing covers of Max Martin recordings. They are also among the few people in the world who have actually heard the originals. Countless self-proclaimed performers on YouTube sing Max Martin songs, but there is not a single publicly available video or audio recording of Martin performing his own stuff. (In the course of researching my book “The Song Machine,” I got to hear an actual Max Martin demo, for “… Baby One More Time,” when a record man who had it on his phone played it for me. The Swede sounded exactly like Spears.) Martin’s demos are the missing originals of our musical age—the blank space at the center of the past two decades of pop music.
Sandberg was born in Stenhamra, a suburb of Stockholm, in 1971. His father was a policeman. He later recalled the handful of recordings his parents had in their collection: Elton John’s “Captain Fantastic,” the best of Queen and Creedence Clearwater Revival, “the Beatles one where they look down from the balcony,” Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons,” and Mozart’s “Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.” Put them all altogether and you&#39;ve got Max Martin.
Sandberg’s older brother was a glam-rock fan, and “he brought home old Kiss cassettes,” Sandberg recalled, in a 2001 interview in Time magazine, which was the first and last time he took part in an English-language profile. Listening to those tapes made young Karl Martin Sandberg want to be a rock star. “I was a hard rocker at that time, and listened to nothing but Kiss,” he told the Swedish documentarian Fredrik Eliasson, in a follow-up to “The Cheiron Saga” that ran on Radio Sweden earlier this year. “I mean, nothing but Kiss. It was like we belonged to a cult: if you listened to anything else, then in principle you were being unfaithful.”
Sandberg learned music through Sweden’s excellent state-sponsored music-education programs, receiving free private lessons in the French horn. (Thirty per cent of Swedish schoolchildren go to publicly funded after-school music programs.) “I first began with the recorder in our community music school,” he remembered in a Radio Sweden interview. “After that I played horn, and participated in the school orchestra. I remember that I started playing brass not so much because I had a calling but because I thought it looked cool.” Eventually, he moved on to drums, then keyboard. He has credited Sweden’s musical-education system with his success, telling Eliasson, “I would not be standing in this place today if it weren’t for the public music school.”
In the mid-eighties, Sandberg became the front man and main songwriter of a glam-metal band called It’s Alive, adopting the stage name Martin White. In the video for the group’s song “Pretend I’m God,” White plays Jesus and enacts a pseudo-crucifixion, doing his best Ozzy Osbourne imitation. While the song must be considered a work of juvenilia, it does at least explain why eighties metal seems to lurk beneath the surface of so many of today’s pop hits.
But Sandberg had a terrible secret, one that he couldn’t share with the rest of the band. He loved pop music. At home, he listened to Depeche Mode’s “Just Can’t Get Enough” and the Bangles’s “Eternal Flame,” which he later told Time was an all-time favorite. “I couldn’t admit to my friends that I liked it,” he said.
In 1994, he met his mentor, a Swedish d.j. who called himself Denniz PoP and co-founded Cheiron Studios. (His real name was Dag Krister Volle; friends called him Dagge.) Denniz realized that Sandberg’s talents lay in songwriting, not performing, and showed him how to use the studio. Denniz was coming off the major hits he had produced for Ace of Base, “All That She Wants” and “The Sign”; one of Sandberg’s first production credits was on “Beautiful Life,” the group’s final hit. By then his mentor had renamed him Max Martin, a drab, forgettable disco name that is almost as bad as Denniz PoP.
Unlike Denniz, who neither wrote nor played music, Martin knew music theory and musical notation. “Martin was very schooled; he could read the notes, write partitions, and do musical arrangements,” E-Type says in “The Cheiron Saga.” “Dagge would say, ‘We need a new influence, so Martin, make us something pretty while E-Type and I run out for some sushi.’ We’d come back and find something so gorgeous that we both almost fell backwards.”
Martin worked by theory, Denniz by feel. “Dagge was driven by his instincts,” E-Type says in the documentary. “If there was something that worked, well, then, that’s what he’d do, always. Martin was the musician, and he got the principles around funk, and with those abilities was able to take it a step further.”
That next step was presented by a boy band that was unknown at the time, the Backstreet Boys. The songs Martin wrote for them, including “We’ve Got It Goin’ On,” “Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely,” and the timeless “I Want It That Way,” made the group world-famous. They also created a template for the Max Martin sound, which combines ABBA’s pop chords and textures, Denniz PoP’s song structure and dynamics, eighties arena rock’s big choruses, and early-nineties American R. &amp; B. grooves. On top of all that is Sandberg’s gift for melody, which owes as much to Edvard Grieg’s dark Norwegian musical fable “In the Hall of the Mountain King” (a.k.a. the “Inspector Gadget” theme song) as to any contemporary influence. Like many of ABBA’s tunes, these Backstreet Boys songs use major and minor chords in surprising combinations (going to a minor chord on the chorus, say, when you least expect it), producing happy songs that sound sad, and sad songs that make you happy—tunes that serve a wide variety of moods.
Perhaps the greatest advantage that Sandberg and his Swedish colleagues enjoyed was their relative freedom from the racial underpinnings of the long-established American distinction between R. &amp; B. and pop. Rhythm and blues, a term coined by the Atlantic Records co-founder Jerry Wexler, back when he was a writer for Billboard, in the fifties, replaced the frankly racist category of “race records,” but the underlying race-based distinction remained: R. &amp; B. was music by and for black people, whereas white performers were “pop,” even if their music was heavily indebted to R. &amp; B. A white American songwriter composing R. &amp; B. tunes was not likely to get very far on the balkanized pop-music scene in the U.S., but a Swedish writer, free of the racist legacy of the R. &amp; B./pop dichotomy, could create music that combined both, and that is just what Martin has done. The resulting hybrid, one could argue, has become the mainstream sound on Top Forty radio today. SiriusXM’s recent rebranding of its pop channel, Venus, which now plays “rhythmic pop” (R. &amp; P.?), is just one measure of this Swedish-led transformation.
The Backstreet Boys were on Jive Records, the label founded by the reclusive South African record man Clive Calder, who is, and for the foreseeable future will be, the richest man the record business has ever produced. (He cashed out of Jive and Zomba, his publishing company, for close to three billion dollars, in 2002.) So when, in 1997, Jive signed a young girl named Britney Spears and was looking for danceable pop songs, it naturally thought of Max Martin.
As it turned out, Martin had a song for Spears. He had composed it with Rami Yacoub, a Swedish-Moroccan beatmaker who was part of the Cheiron team. The song, initially called “Hit Me Baby (One More Time),” had been written for TLC, the three-woman R. &amp; B. group. When Martin sent TLC a demo, which featured the Swede doing four-part harmonies all by himself, the trio had rejected it. Years later, T-Boz, the leader of the group, recalled the decision in a MTV interview: “I was like, I like the song, but do I think it’s a hit? Do I think it’s TLC? ... Was I going to say, ‘Hit me, baby, one more time’? Hell, no!”
“Max, at that point in his career, thought he was writing an R. &amp; B. song,” Steve Lunt, the Jive A. &amp; R. man who was assigned to the Spears project, told me. “Whereas, in reality, he was writing a Swedish pop song. It was ABBA with a groove, basically.” There is a funky bass slap in the song that sounds urban, and on the demo Martin does that cowboy-sounding “owww” made famous by Cameo and beloved by Denniz PoP. “But all those chords are so European, how could that possibly be an American R. &amp; B. song?” Lunt continued. “No black artist was going to sing it.” He added, “But that was the genius of Max Martin. Without being fully aware of it, he’d forged a brilliant sound all his own, and within a few weeks every American producer was desperately scrambling to emulate it.”
When TLC rejected the song, Martin offered it to Robyn, the Swedish artist, but nothing came of that, either. After meeting Spears in New York, he went back to Stockholm, worked on the song a little more to tailor it for Spears, made a copy, and mailed it to Jive. (Although his career as a performer was over, Martin still looked like Martin White, the hirsute glam-metal front man, and his appearance initially alarmed Spears, who said, “I thought he was from Mötley Crüe or something.”) All the hooks in the song were worked up to their finished state, but most of the verses were unfinished, often mere vowel sounds. There was no bridge yet, because, as Lunt put it, “Max would say, ‘If you don’t like the song by then, fuck you’—in his polite Swedish way, of course.” When the demo reached Jive, everyone thought, “Holy shit, this is perfect,” according to Lunt.
“Hit Me Baby (One More Time)” is a song about obsession, and it takes all of two seconds to hook you, not once but twice, first with the swung triplet “Da nah nah” and then with that alluring growl-purr that Spears emits with her first line (following Martin’s trace vocal): “Oh, baby, bay-bee.” Then the funky Cheiron backbeat kicks in, with drums that sound like percussion grenades. Next comes Tomas Lindberg’s wah-wah guitar lines, which signal to one’s inner disco hater that it can relax: it’s a rock song, after all.
And yet the vocal hook, irresistible as it was, sounded odd. You weren’t sure it was O.K. to sing it out loud. It was hard to imagine that anyone forwhom English is a first language would write the phrase “Hit me, baby” without intending it as an allusion to domestic violence or S &amp; M. That was the furthest thing from the minds of the gentle Swedes, who were only trying to use up-to-the-minute lingo. Jive, concerned that Americans might get the wrong idea, changed the title to “... Baby One More Time.”
The song was Martin’s first Billboard No. 1. “I don’t really think we understood what we had done,” he says in “The Cheiron Saga.” “I actually remember that specific moment; I remember sitting in the studio when they called me to let me know that my song had made No. 1 in the U.S.A. And that was incredible, but I also remember that I had so much going on with everything else right then, I didn’t really grasp the meaning of it.”
Although Martin may be sui generis, he is by no means the only disciple of Denniz PoP to go on to chart-topping success. Others, including Andreas Carlsson, Jörgen Elofsson, and Per Magnusson, also have long track records of hits; they’ve been especially successful with U.K. boy bands. According to Marie Ledin, the managing director of the Polar Music Prize, Sweden’s musical Nobel, Swedish songwriters and producers were partly responsible for a quarter of all Billboard Top Ten hits in 2014, an astonishing accomplishment for a country of fewer than ten million people. Clearly, there is more at work here than individual genius. Apart from the country’s musical-education system, what qualities and characteristics make Swedes so good at producing pop songs?
Generally speaking, there is a flowing melodic element in Swedish folk songs and hymns (the national anthem, “Thou Ancient, Thou Free,” even sounds a bit like a pop song) that has rooted itself in the sensibility of many a musical Swede. More specifically, the relative computer literacy of the population, combined with the country’s excellent broadband infrastructure, has allowed Swedes to excel at making music on computers, and collaborating with other composers over the Internet, which has become the standard method of pop songwriting today. Added to that is Sweden’s xenophilia—its love of other cultures, in particular Anglo-American cultures. In Sweden, American TV isn’t translated into the local language, as it is in France and Italy, say, and the music you hear on the radio is more likely to be sung in English than Swedish. More than ninety per cent of Swedes speak English.
But, while knowing English is clearly an advantage to songwriters and producers seeking success in the U.S. and the U.K., a lack of facility with the finer points of the language is equally important. Swedish writers are not partial to wit, metaphor, or double entendre, songwriting staples from Tin Pan Alley through the Brill Building era. They are more inclined to fit the syllables to the sounds—a working method that Martin calls “melodic math”—and not worry too much about whether the resulting lines make sense. (The verses in “I Want It That Way,” for example, completely contradict the meaning of the chorus lines.) Fans of Cole Porter may see this development in roughly in the same spirit that “Downton Abbey” fans might view “Keeping Up with the Kardashians”—with horror—but one can argue that this very freedom from having to make sense lyrically has allowed the Swedes to soar to such melodic heights.
Finally, while Sweden has a strong songwriting culture, it lacks an equally strong culture of performing. Klas Åhlund, a successful Swedish songwriter and producer in his forties, who is also a performer (in the rock band Teddybears), told me, “Swedes are very musical, and they love to write songs. But it’s a big country, and it has very few people in it. So you had these farmers out there who were good at writing songs but had no one to sing them. Songwriting was just a thing you did on your own when you were watching the cows, a kind of meditation. You didn’t focus as much on your ability as a performer as you did on the structure and craft of the songs. Which is really not the case in the U.S., where your charm and your voice and your powers as a performer come immediately into play.”
A nation of songwriters endowed with melodic gifts, meticulous about craft but reluctant to perform their own songs, is a potential goldmine for a nation of wannabe pop stars who don’t write their own material, which is often the case in the U.S. By hooking up the two countries, musically speaking, Martin and his peers changed pop songwriting.
Martin’s legacy must be measured not only by the number of hits that he and his Swedish colleagues have created but also by the songwriting methods that they have instilled around the world. (Many K-pop songs are the result of collaborations between Korean and Swedish songwriting teams.) A strong part of Denniz PoP’s vision for Cheiron was that songwriting should be a collaborative effort; no one was supposed to be proprietary about his work, and Martin has passed these principles on to two generations of songwriters. Songwriters are assigned different parts of a song to work on; choruses can be taken from one song and tried in another; a bridge might be swapped out, or a hook. Songs are written more like television shows, by teams of writers who willingly share credit. In a Swedish TV documentary called “The Nineties,” E-Type describes the working conditions at Denniz PoP’s studio. “I get this feeling of a big painter’s studio in Italy, back in the fourteen-hundreds or fifteen-hundreds. One assistant does the hands, another does the feet, and another does something else, and then Michelangelo walks in and says, ‘That’s really great; just turn it slightly. Now it’s good; put it in a golden frame, and out with it. Next!’ ” The description might apply equally well to Martin’s home studio, in Los Angeles (Frank Sinatra once lived there, and he sublet the pool house to Marilyn Monroe), where he is now the master.
Lennon and McCartney wrote almost all of their hits with each other, and while they had assistance from others in their solo careers, the level of collaboration was nothing like their former partnership. Martin, on the other hand, has consistently sought out new, fresh collaborators when the heat of a previous partnership begins to cool, which is why his magic touch has lasted longer than even Sir Paul’s. These protégés—Dr. Luke is the best known, but by no means the only one—often go on to be major hitmakers in their own right, and acquire and mentor their own protégés, who become hitmakers, too, spreading Swedish methods further and further into the songwriting mainstream. Martin is their Obi Wan.
And yet, for all his success and influence, there is something missing in Martin’s oeuvre, when compared to the Beatles’s. It’s not the quality of the songs—history will judge whether they have what it takes to endure. It’s the absence of a broader political and cultural framework in which to place the songs. The story of the Beatles, from “I Want to Hold Your Hand” to “Let It Be,” is a story of the sixties—politics, war, protest, drugs, free love, and how the songwriters responded to those forces. The hits are embedded within albums that offer rich, complex musical statements, and insights into the artists’ personal development and changes. What story does Martin’s string of No. 1s tell, from “... Baby One More Time” to “Can’t Feel My Face,” his most recent? What changes do they trace? The songs are all about the same thing, more or less, which is not the same thing at all.
