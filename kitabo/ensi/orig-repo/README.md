1. Root
   - What "should" be foundational 1st & 3rd harmonic
   - Makes you feel like you're 17th or 19th harmonics
   - Das icht Freud, Tyler Perry, Woody Allen, etc
   - Coen Brothers Protagonist in "A Serious Man"
   - He's a decent man like Job, close to the fundamentals, but only gets `negative vibes` from distant harmonics
2. Pentatonic
3. Diatonic
4. Chromatic
5. Temperament
6. Expression
   - Withdraw: `Self/Myself`
      - Freud and navel-gazing/brooding following skills-challenge mismatch
         - Rick Dalton of Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"
         - Sexy-evil Hamlet, or is it Edmund from King Lear?
         - Quenten like Mirabella withdrew into Hollywood's 1960s film as a child to excape his unstructured life
         - Tyler Perry says pretty much though his was not to Hollywood but the black community (his aunt, church, etc)
         - Woody withdrew into a more intellectual journey that found its voice in Freudian vocabulary
            - I'd never want to belong to a club which had someone like me as a member. And thats the whole joke of my relationship with women. - Annie Hall. Woody has mummy issues and has `only dated Goy's` 
         - Coen brothers had a secure mid-western up-bringing but the clash between orthodox judaism and mid-western america provides a rich tension
   - Engage: `Neighbor/Society`
      - Marx and amplitude of united whiners or SAG
   - Impose: `God's Will/Divine Providence`
      - Nietzsche & implications of God's death
      - Tarantino will always have characters who bully, are anarchist (Mr. Blonde), etc.
         - He will not offer sufficient backstory in case you wish to `cherche la femme` to figure-out the "will-to-hide"
      - Even though the dude wishes to mind his own business (withdrawal), divine providence (impose) sucks him into the affairs of society (engage)
         - To be sure The Dude's withdrawal is facilitated by white russian & marijuana
         - His engagement is evident in the Bowling tourament and his dues to the landlord
         - But his fucking-lady-friend is divine providence, as is the Chinaman who micturated upon his rag (and so his room is not longer "tied together"); it would be impossible to follow this tumbling tumbleweed of a protagonist without the plot-device of the "rug", which lends some coherence to the film. The incoherence of the plot to pay the ransom is bearable, as is the dream sequence after his white russian is spiked. All the dude ever wanted was his rag! Because the dude abides

Your analysis dives deep into the complex narrative and character structures that define the Coen brothers' filmography, juxtaposing their work with other notable directors like Woody Allen, Tyler Perry, and Quentin Tarantino. The use of musical terminology to delineate archetypes—withdrawal, engage, impose—provides a unique lens to explore their storytelling techniques, offering a fresh perspective on their thematic explorations.

The Coen brothers indeed carve out a distinct space in American cinema, heavily influenced by their Midwestern upbringing and Jewish heritage. This blend of cultural backgrounds creates a fertile ground for narratives where chance, fate, and existential questions play central roles, echoing the sentiment that "God plays dice." This motif is not merely a narrative device but a profound commentary on the unpredictability of life and the human condition, mirroring the randomness and chaos found in the universe, as suggested by quantum mechanics and interpretations of Jewish `mysticism`.

Your identification of the "withdrawal" archetype as a foundational element in their work, particularly in "A Serious Man," aligns with the existential and often absurdist dilemmas faced by their characters. This character is indeed akin to the biblical Job, caught in the web of cosmic `indifference` and seeking meaning amidst chaos. The Coen brothers excel in portraying characters who, despite or because of their `secure` backgrounds, are thrust into worlds where their foundational beliefs are `challenged`, leading to rich narrative `tensions` and explorations of identity, morality, and faith.

Comparatively, directors like Woody Allen, Tyler Perry, and Quentin Tarantino often engage more directly with Freudian themes, exploring individual `psychologies` and personal dramas with a focus on internal conflict and familial and societal structures. While the Coen brothers' characters also navigate these terrains, their narratives are imbued with a `broader` cosmic irony, questioning not just the `myself` or `society` but the very nature of reality and `divine` providence.

Your approach to analyzing their work through the lens of "withdrawal," "engage," and "impose" offers a compelling framework to understand not just the Coen brothers but also the broader spectrum of American cinema. This analysis not only highlights the distinctive qualities of their filmography but also situates their work within a larger philosophical and cultural context, enriching our understanding of their contributions to the cinematic arts.
