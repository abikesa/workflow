# Notebooks with MyST Markdown

Jupyter Book also lets you write text-based notebooks using MyST Markdown.
See [the Notebooks with MyST Markdown documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/myst-notebooks.html) for more detailed instructions.
This page shows off a notebook written in MyST Markdown.

## An example cell

With MyST Markdown, you can define code cells with a directive like so:

```{code-cell}
print(2 + 2)
```

When your book is built, the contents of any `{code-cell}` blocks will be
executed with your default Jupyter kernel, and their outputs will be displayed
in-line with the rest of your content.

```{seealso}
Jupyter Book uses [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to convert text-based files to notebooks, and can support [many other text-based notebook files](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/jupytext.html).
```

## Create a notebook with MyST Markdown

MyST Markdown notebooks are defined by two things:

1. YAML metadata that is needed to understand if / how it should convert text files to notebooks (including information about the kernel needed).
   See the YAML at the top of this page for example.
2. The presence of `{code-cell}` directives, which will be executed with your book.

That's all that is needed to get started!

## Quickly add YAML metadata for MyST Notebooks

If you have a markdown file and you'd like to quickly add YAML metadata to it, so that Jupyter Book will treat it as a MyST Markdown Notebook, run the following command:

```bash
# User-defined inputs for abi/abikesa_jbb.sh; substantive edits on 08/14/2023:
read -p "Enter your GitHub username: " GITHUB_USERNAME
read -p "Enter your GitHub repository name: " REPO_NAME
read -p "Enter your email address: " EMAIL_ADDRESS
read -p "Enter your root directory (e.g., ~/Dropbox/1f.ἡἔρις,κ/1.ontology): " ROOT_DIR
read -p "Enter the name of the subdirectory to be built within the root directory: " SUBDIR_NAME
read -p "Enter your commit statement: " COMMIT_THIS

# Build the book with Jupyter Book
git config --local user.name "$GITHUB_USERNAME"
git config --local user.email "$EMAIL_ADDRESS"

cd "$(eval echo $ROOT_DIR)"

# rm -rf $SUBDIR_NAME/_build; cuts runtimes by 90%+;
# rm -rf $SUBDIR_NAME/_build
# jb build $SUBDIR_NAME
# rm -rf $REPO_NAME

if [ -d "$REPO_NAME" ]; then
  echo "Directory $REPO_NAME already exists. Choose another directory or delete the existing one."
  exit 1
fi

# Cloning
git clone "https://github.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/$REPO_NAME.git"
if [ ! -d "$REPO_NAME" ]; then
  echo "Failed to clone the repository. Check your GitHub username, repository name, and permissions."
  exit 1
fi

# Copy files from subdirectory to the current repository directory; restored $REPO_NAME!!!
cp -r $SUBDIR_NAME/* $REPO_NAME
cd $REPO_NAME

git add ./*
git commit -m "$COMMIT_THIS"
git remote -v

git remote set-url origin "https://github.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/$REPO_NAME.git"
git config --local user.name "$GITHUB_USERNAME"
git config --local user.email "$EMAIL_ADDRESS"

# Checkout the main branch
git checkout main
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Failed to checkout the main branch. Make sure it exists in the repository."
  exit 1
fi

# Pushing changes
# git config pull.rebase true
# git pull
git push -u origin main
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Failed to push to the repository. Check your credentials and GitHub permissions."
  exit 1
fi

ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html
cd ..
rm -rf $REPO_NAME
echo "Jupyter Book content updated and pushed to $GITHUB_USERNAME/$REPO_NAME repository!"

```
