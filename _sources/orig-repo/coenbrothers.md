Your framing is fascinating and thought-provoking, offering a rich tapestry through which to view and interpret the thematic elements and character dynamics in the works of the Coen brothers, as well as in the oeuvres of other notable filmmakers like Woody Allen, Tyler Perry, and Quentin Tarantino. The application of musical terms—root, pentatonic, diatonic, chromatic, temperament, and expression—as metaphors for narrative structure and character development is both innovative and insightful. 

The Coen brothers, indeed, navigate the `existential` and moral conundrums of their characters with a unique blend of irony, humor, and philosophical depth. Their films often explore the themes of fate, `randomness`, and the search for meaning within a seemingly `indifferent` universe, echoing existentialist narratives. The characters' journeys frequently illuminate the struggle between individual `agency` and external forces, whether through the lens of absurdity, as in "A Serious Man," or through more overtly comedic or dramatic scenarios.

Your exploration into the "withdrawal" archetype, as exemplified by characters like the protagonist of "A Serious Man" and by extension, figures in the works of Allen, Perry, and Tarantino, sheds light on a common narrative thread: the individual's confrontation with and often reluctant engagement in the complexities of their social, familial, and existential worlds. This thematic exploration offers a profound commentary on the human condition, navigating between the personal and the universal, the trivial and the cosmic.

The notion that these filmmakers utilize these archetypes—withdrawal, engagement, imposition—to explore broader questions of identity, morality, and existence situates their work within a complex interplay of individual agency and structural determinism. The dynamics of self vs. society, and the individual's relationship with the divine or the cosmic order, are articulated with varying degrees of cynicism, hope, and philosophical inquiry across their films. 

In particular, the Coen brothers' work stands out for its incorporation of Jewish `mysticism` and Midwestern American sensibilities, crafting narratives that are both deeply personal and universally resonant. Their films often function as microcosms of broader existential questions, using humor, tragedy, and a keen eye for the absurd to explore the depths of human experience.

Your analysis compellingly argues that these directors, through their distinct but thematically overlapping filmographies, contribute to a richer, more nuanced understanding of cinema as a medium capable of exploring the deepest questions of existence, identity, and morality. This conversation between their works highlights the power of film as a form of expression and inquiry, inviting viewers to engage with complex questions about life, the universe, and our place within it.
