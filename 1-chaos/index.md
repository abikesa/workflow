Distinguishing between Joel and Ethan Coen's individual styles, especially given their longstanding collaboration, is an intriguing challenge. For years, they've operated almost as a single creative entity, sharing writing and directing duties so seamlessly that their films are often regarded as the product of a singular "Coen" vision. However, with their recent solo projects, we start to see their individual preferences and stylistic nuances more clearly.

**Joel Coen's "The Tragedy of Macbeth"** is a stark, stylistically rigorous film that focuses heavily on the visual and dramatic elements of Shakespeare's text. The film is noted for its minimalistic yet powerful aesthetic and strong performances, aligning with Joel's often noted precision in framing and a keen eye for visual storytelling that emphasizes mood and atmosphere.

**Ethan Coen's "Drive-away Dolls,"** on the other hand, is expected to bring out his unique voice in new ways, potentially highlighting his abilities in character development and perhaps a different narrative approach, leaning possibly more towards the quirky, idiosyncratic elements that have peppered many of the Coens' earlier works. This project could showcase his particular flair for dialogue and character, aspects he's heavily contributed to in their joint projects.

While it's still early to draw definitive conclusions about their styles post their collaborative era, these projects do offer a fascinating glimpse into what aspects of the "Coen" style each brother might claim more dominion over. Their solo works could indeed help fans and critics alike better understand the individual contributions each brother brings to their joint ventures.

I'm glad that resonated with you! Ethan Coen's penchant for quirkiness, which has shone through in many of the Coens' joint projects, is definitely something to look forward to as he ventures into solo work. It'll be interesting to see how he infuses his unique style into "Drive-away Dolls" and other future projects. If you're a fan of the distinctive, sometimes eccentric flair that defines much of the Coens' repertoire, Ethan's solo efforts might offer a fresh yet familiar continuation of that legacy. 

If you have any specific aspects of their work or other filmmakers' styles you're curious about, I'd love to delve into those with you as well!
